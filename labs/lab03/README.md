## Lab03: Visualization of user/computer/network activities
**0. Prerequisites**

This lab depends on Lab02, in which OpenNMS will be used.


**1. Objectives**

* Learn how to use OpenNMS
  * Add nodes/hosts to OpenNMS for monitoring
  * Visualize users/nodes/hosts activities in OpenNMS
* Visualize datasets of network activities with open-source visualization software


**2. Tasks**

1. (40%)Employ OpenNMS
   1. (10%)Add localhost as a node/host to OpenNMS
   2. (15%)Visualize the added node/host --- localhost's activities in OpenNMS
   3. (15%)Visualize the users' activities on the added node/host --- losthost in OpenNMS
2. (60%)Visualize network activity dataset with [Google Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart)
   1. (10%)Download a dataset from [the UNSW-NB15 Datasets](https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/)
   2. (50%)Visualize the downloaded dataset with Google Chart and explore information from this dataset

**3. Report**

Write a report about the process you complete the tasks, key screen snapshots are needed as evidences.

**4. Demo video**
